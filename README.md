## Usage

Creates an AWS S3 Bucket used to host files served by AWS CloudFront.

```hcl
module "cloudfront_bucket" {
  source = "dod-iac/cloudfront-bucket/aws"

  aws_cloudfront_origin_access_identity_arn = aws_cloudfront_origin_access_identity.main.iam_arn
  name = format("app-%s-www-%s-%s", var.application, var.environment, var.region)
  logging_target_bucket = var.logs_bucket_name
  tags = {
    Application = var.application
    Environment = var.environment
    Automation  = "Terraform"
  }
}
```

Pass an aliased provider to the module as `aws`, to change the region the bucket is in.

```hcl
module "cloudfront_bucket" {
  source = "dod-iac/cloudfront-bucket/aws"

  providers = {
    aws           = aws.us-east-1
  }

  aws_cloudfront_origin_access_identity_arn = aws_cloudfront_origin_access_identity.main.iam_arn
  name = format("app-%s-www-%s-%s", var.application, var.environment, "us-east-1")
  logging_target_bucket = var.logs_bucket_name
  tags = {
    Application = var.application
    Environment = var.environment
    Automation  = "Terraform"
  }
}
```

## Terraform Version

Terraform 0.13. Pin module version to ~> 2.0.0 . Submit pull-requests to master branch.

Terraform 0.12. Pin module version to ~> 1.0.0 . Submit pull-requests to terraform012 branch.

Terraform 0.11 is not supported.

## Upgrade Paths

### Upgrading from 1.0.0 to 2.x.x

Version 2.x.x removes the `region` variable.  Pass an aliased provider to the module as `aws`, to change the region the bucket is in.
